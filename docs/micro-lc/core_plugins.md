To extend the potential of `micro-lc`, Mia-Platform created some [configurable](./core_configuration.md#props) plugins called `core plugins`.

These plugins are open source and can be deployed using the console with low effort.

## microlc-element-composer

This plugin is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/mia-platform/microlc-element-composer) and 
can be used to compose the UI of your page, with the precondition that each piece has been made as [`custom-elements`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements).

The layout can be composed using rows and columns: it will be adaptive thanks to the `flex` layout.

:::caution
In addition to the [properties that you can configure](./core_plugins.md#config) for each `custom-element`, 
the plugin **always** injects 3 properties called `eventBus`, `currentUser`, and `headers`:
`eventBus` is an [RxJS's Subject](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subject) used as communication channel between components.

`currentUser` is an object which may represent the session currently authenticated user.

`headers` is an object made of standard/custom HTTP headers which may propagate cookies and other helpful settings in order to manage frontend HTTP calls.
